# Develop a class that simulates the keyboard of a phone.
# Digits that are pressed are stored in the phone via a method press() until a signal is received to dial the number.
# Add a key backspace to be able to erase one digit and another key clear to clear the digits already stored.
# A phone number should have at least 10 digits before dialing the number.
