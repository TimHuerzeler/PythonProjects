# We want to develop a graphic editor that allows us to manipulate shapes such as circles, rectangles, square, ellipse, etc.
# Implement only the classes that represent the shapes using inheritance and abstract classes or interfaces. Equip each class
# with a method area() that returns the surface of the shape. Add a class Group that contains a group of shapes with the method area()
# that sums the area of every shape of the group. Add a method to each class a method move() used to move a shape of dx and dy units.
# First, draw a UML class diagram that models the relationships between the shapes classes.
# Consult abstract classes for more information about abstract classes.
