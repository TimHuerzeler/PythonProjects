# Design and implement a class Car with the following functionalities:
# -A car has a certain gas consumption (measured on liters/100km),
# -A car's tank has a certain gas level (measured in liters). Most cars have a tank size of 30 l.
# The gas consumption is specified in the constructor, whereas the tank is initially empty. Provide methods to:
# -Fill up the tank (liters),
# -Drive a certain distance (km),
# -Return the current amount of gas (liters).
